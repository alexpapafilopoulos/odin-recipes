        <h2 class="desc">Description</h2>
        <p>These vegan brownies are made with cocoa powder for a rich and gooey
            chocolaty treat. If you prefer brownies that are a little more
            solid, you can bake the brownies for longer than the recommended
            time. Great for people with egg or dairy allergies, too!</p>
        <h2 class="ingred">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>2 cups granulated white sugar</li>

            <li>¾ cup good-quality unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>

            <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>

            <li>1 cup hot water or coffee</li>

            <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>

            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="dir">Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with baking spray; line bottom with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Whisk flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl until combined.</li>
            <li>Pour in water (or coffee), vegetable oil, and vanilla; mix until well-blended. Spread batter evenly in the prepared dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is no longer shiny and center feels just set when gently pressed, about 30 minutes. Let cool for at least 10 minutes before cutting into 15 squares.</li>
        </ol>
